# 🚀 LeetCode Practice Log

Auto-generated summary of my LeetCode problem-solving journey.
🧠 Project Description
This is a personal project to solve LeetCode problems daily and automatically sync all solved problems to local storage. It helps me organize, review, and track my coding practice in a systematic way.

🚀 Script Features
The auto_leetcode_sync.py script provides the following functionality:

🔍 Fetches the list of submitted problems using leetcode-cli.

🧠 Downloads solution code for each problem in the selected languages (e.g., Python, Java).

📁 Creates folders and saves solutions with proper naming (ID-Problem-Title) and includes metadata like difficulty, date solved, and problem link.

📝 Auto-generates a README.md file summarizing all solved problems in a neat table format.

📅 Daily Routine
After solving the Daily Challenge on LeetCode each day, I run this script to:

Save the problem and solution locally.

Keep track of my problem-solving history.

Update the summary README for easier progress tracking and review.
